# Dynamic Kanban Borad

## Overview

Dynamic Kanban Board is a lightweight, drag-and-drop task management app built with Core JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, and CSS3. It allows users to create tasks, move them across columns (To Do, In Progress, Done), and persist data locally using localStorage so tasks remain even after page reload.

The project is designed to demonstrate modular code architecture, with clear separation of concerns (storage, rendering, drag & drop, event handling).

## Technologies Used 
  - JavaScript (ES6+ – modular pattern, DOM manipulation)
  - HTML5
  - CSS3 (Responsive, modern UI)
  - LocalStorage (for persistence)
